# cloudflare-gateway

This setup credits this blog post @marco-lancini and their blog post [Serverless Ad Blocking with Cloudflare Gateway](https://blog.marcolancini.it/2022/blog-serverless-ad-blocking-with-cloudflare-gateway/)

This module helps you setup a [Cloudflare Teams Gateway](https://blog.cloudflare.com/protect-your-team-with-cloudflare-gateway/) & mimics Pi-hole behaviour.

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Abstract this as a terraform module that anyone can consume
- [ ] Use Github actions to automate how the pihole domain list is updated
